Add detailed godoc comments to all exported types and functions:\n```go\n// Client represents a SockJS client that communicates with a SockJS server.\n// It manages the connection lifecycle and provides methods to send and receive messages.\ntype Client interface {\n    // Connect establishes a connection to the SockJS server.\n    // It returns an error if the connection cannot be established within the context timeout.\n    Connect(ctx context.Context) error\n    \n    // Session returns the current active session.\n    // Returns nil if no connection has been established.\n    Session() Session\n    \n    // Close closes the connection to the SockJS server.\n    // It blocks until the connection is closed or the context is canceled.\n    Close() error\n}\n```\n\n2. Create examples in examples/ directory:\n   - examples/simple/main.go - Basic usage example\n   - examples/reconnect/main.go - Reconnection example\n   - examples/options/main.go - Configuration options example\n\n3. Add example tests that appear in godoc:\n```go\nfunc ExampleClient() {\n    // Create client\n    client, err := sockjs.NewClient(sockjs.ClientConfig{\n        ServerURL: \"http://localhost:8080/echo\",\n        Transports: []string{\"websocket\"},\n    })\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to create client: %v\", err)\n    }\n    \n    // Connect to server\n    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\n    defer cancel()\n    \n    err = client.Connect(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to connect: %v\", err)\n    }\n    \n    // Get session\n    session := client.Session()\n    \n    // Send message\n    err = session.Send(ctx, \"Hello, SockJS!\")\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to send message: %v\", err)\n    }\n    \n    // Receive message\n    msg, err := session.Receive(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"Failed to receive message: %v\", err)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(msg)\n    \n    // Close connection\n    client.Close()\n    // Output: Hello, SockJS!\n}\n```\n\n4. Update README.md with detailed usage instructions\n5. Add badges for GoDoc, Go Report Card, and test coverage",

Documentation mentions limitations and considerations\n7. Documentation format follows Go standards",

The library will be thoroughly tested against real SockJS servers to ensure compliance with the SockJS protocol."
